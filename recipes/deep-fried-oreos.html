    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Deep-fried Oreos are a perfect way to spice up any festival or gathering! In a general sense
        Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried for this recipe. More specifically,
        make the batter, dip the cookies in the batter, and fry until they're golden brown!
        No deep-fryer is necessary! For a final touch, dust with powdered sugar for a memorable
        presentation!
